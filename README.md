By analyzing data from a range of countries, the study examines how factors such as GDP, healthcare spending, population density, and climate conditions impact disease outcomes across different contexts. To provide a comprehensive analysis, countries are categorized into four groups: DEVELOPED, DEVELOPING, UNDERDEVELOPED, and ISLAND allowing for a nuanced understanding of how these factors affect each group differently.Assess how socioeconomic and environmental factors influence the outcomes of COVID-19 and Influenza across a diverse set of countries.
